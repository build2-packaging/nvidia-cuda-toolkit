# libnvrtc - A C library

NVRTC is a runtime compilation library for CUDA C++. It accepts CUDA C++
source code in character string form and creates handles that can be used
to obtain the PTX. The PTX string generated by NVRTC can be loaded by
cuModuleLoadData and cuModuleLoadDataEx, and linked with other modules by
using the nvJitLink library or using cuLinkAddData of the CUDA Driver API.
This facility can often provide optimizations and performance not possible
in a purely offline static compilation.

## Usage

To start using `libnvrtc` in your project, add the following `depends`
value to your `manifest`, adjusting the version constraint as appropriate:

```
depends: libnvrtc ^<VERSION>
```

Then import the library in your `buildfile`:

```
import libs = libnvrtc%lib{nvrtc}
```


## Importable targets

This package provides the following importable targets:

```
lib{nvrtc}
```
